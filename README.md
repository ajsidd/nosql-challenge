## Introduction

The Eat Safe, Love challenge simulates real-world scenarios of working with MongoDB and conducting data analysis on food establishment data. The challenge consists of multiple parts, each focusing on different aspects of MongoDB usage and data analysis techniques.

In this challenge, we explore a dataset containing information about various food establishments, including their names, types, hygiene scores, ratings, and geographical locations. The goal is to leverage MongoDB's capabilities to import, update, and analyze this data effectively.
